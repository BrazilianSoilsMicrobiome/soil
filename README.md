# Welcome to the Repository of the Brazilian Soils Microbiome Database


The anthropic effects on the soil cause changes in its characteristics, modifying its microbiome and functioning. To allocate data on the characteristics of Brazilian soils, promote new studies and monitoring, we present an interactive website for people to explore the characteristics of different soil samples across Brazil!

Click this [*link*](https://braziliansoilsmicrobiome.github.io/soil/) to interact with our data!

We will keep in this repo all the code used to run the database, some small datasets, the R scripts used to render this page (in resources folder) and all files to deploy the site (stylized with Jekyll).
